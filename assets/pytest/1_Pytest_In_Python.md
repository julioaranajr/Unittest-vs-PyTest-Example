# PyTest in Python

## What is PyTest?

PyTest is a testing framework that is used to write tests in Python. It is a powerful testing framework that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests.

PyTest is a popular testing framework that is used by many developers to write tests for their code. It provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests, and it is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests.

## Why Use PyTest?

PyTest is a powerful testing framework that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests. It is a popular testing framework that is used by many developers to write tests for their code.

## How to Use PyTest?

To use PyTest, you need to install the PyTest library using the following command:

```bash

pip install pytest

```

Once you have installed the PyTest library, you can write and run tests using the PyTest framework. PyTest provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests, and it is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests.

We will learn more about how to use PyTest in the next chapter.

## Unitests vs PyTest

Unittest and PyTest are two popular testing frameworks that are used to write tests in Python. Unittest is a testing framework that is included with Python, while PyTest is a third-party testing framework that is used to write tests in Python.

### Main Differences

- Unittest provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

- PyTest is a powerful testing framework that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests.

## Which One to Use?

Both Unittest and PyTest are powerful testing frameworks that provide a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. The choice of which testing framework to use depends on your specific requirements and preferences.

The Unittest framework is included with Python, so if you are already using Python, you may want to consider using the Unittest framework. However, if you are looking for a more powerful and feature-rich testing framework, you may want to consider using the PyTest framework.

## Who is the most easy to use?

PyTest is considered to be more easy to use than Unittest. PyTest provides a simple and intuitive interface for writing and running tests, and it is easy to use and provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned about PyTest and how it can be used to write tests in Python. We learned about the importance of testing, the PyTest framework, and how to use the PyTest framework to write and run tests for your code.

## What's Next?

In the next chapter, we will learn about the [Fixtures](assets/pytest/2_Fixtures_In_Pytest.md) in PyTest and how they can be used to set up and tear down resources for your tests.
